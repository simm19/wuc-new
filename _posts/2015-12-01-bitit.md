  Bitit is a digital gift card costing from 25€ to 250€ that can be redeemed into Bitcoins.<br>

  With just an email, the recipient will get his bitcoin anywhere in the world.<br>

  Bitit makes the buying of Bitcoin as easy as buying music online.<br>

  We democratize Bitcoin buying for everyone through the coolest and simplest bitcoin product, a Bitcoin Gift Certificate.<br>

  Bitit eGift cards are denominated in euros. The stored funds can be redeemed in Bitcoins on the Bitit platform. In this way, Bitit maintains the exact value of the card until the user activates it to receive his bitcoins.<br>
  We simplify all the paperwork process. No ID required, depending of the chosen payment method.<br>

  Bitcoiners should have a way to have their family and friends discover Bitcoins in seconds. What’s better than a gift card  to do it ?

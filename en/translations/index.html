<title>Translations - We Use Coins</title>
<meta name="description" content="We need help translating We Use Coins into other languages.">

<h2>Help Us Translate WeUseCoins</h2>

<p>Code and instructions are on <a href="https://github.com/sunnankar/wuc-new">GitHub</a>. If you want to help but have no programming skills then contact us and we will see if someone is available to do the technical parts.
<p>Please take care to provide accurate translations based on the English version of WeUseCoins and to respect the guidelines in the README. Thanks for your help!
<p>Each localized version of WUC is independent of each other and uses static HTML, CSS or PHP files.
<p>Folders are currently ready for the following languages:
<ul><li>Chinese [CN]</li><li>Dutch [nl or nl1]</li></li><li><b>English [en] (This is the default source.)</b></li><li>German [de or de1]</li><li>Finnish [fi]</li><li>French [fr or fr1]</li><li>Greek [gr]</li><li>Polish [pl]</li><li>Japanese [ja or ja1]</li><li>Polish [pl]</li><li>Portugese [pt]</li><li>Russian [ru]</li><li>Spanish [es]</li><li>Swedish [se]</li></ul>

There are legacy versions of German [de], Dutch [nl], French [fr] and Japanese [ja]. After a sufficient amount has been translated in the new folders [/de1/ /fr1/ /ja1/ and /nl1/] then we will migrate from the legacy versions.

If you would like to work on a language where the folder structure has not been setup then create an issue for inclusion or submit the appropriate pull request.

<b>Example:</b> You want to translate to Spanish.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>(1)</b> In _includes/default-es.html change lines 31-37 at /es/page by translating the anchor text [Note: This will make sure the internal link structure is correct.].</li><li><b>(2)</b> Begin translating pages and we recommend in this order (1) homepage [index], (2) getting started, (3) glossary, (4) questions [FAQ], (5) price, (6) mining guide, (7) merchant and (8) get free bitcoins.</li></ul><p>

This order should help get useful content available most efficiently.
<h3><em>What is Bitcoin?</em> | Video</h3>
The WeUseCoins video subtitles have been translated into dozens of languages, see the <a href="/en/materials">materials page</a>. You will also find the sound effects on this page, which you can use to record the video in your own language with an editing software such as audacity.
